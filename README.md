> Video.js source handler for supporting Fairplay streaming.

## Protected Content

This source handler **only** supports encrypted HLS playback. It does not contain any fallbacks. The premise is to use this in tandem with [videojs-contrib-dash](https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-dash/) to support encrypted playback in all* browsers.

If the browser (a.k.a Safari) supports Encrypted Media Extensions and includes a Content Decryption Module, video.js will be able to playback protected content.

## Getting Started

```html
<script src="/path/to/videojs.fairplay.min.js"></script>

<script>
videojs('player_id').ready(function () {
  this.src({
    src: '/path/to/file.m3u8',
    type: 'application/x-mpegURL',

    protection: {
      keySystem: 'com.apple.fps.1_0',

      certificateUrl: '/path/to/certificate',
      licenseUrl: '/path/to/license',

      // Optional settings

      // Instead of a certificateUrl send the cert in a string
      certificate: 'base64string',

      // Object to add any extra license request headers that might be needed
      licenseRequestHeaders: {
        'my-extra-header': 'some important information'
      },

      // Function to call back with license response content if it errors
      licenseResponseErrorContent: function (content) {
        // Do something with the license response content here
        console.log(content);
      },

      // Function to handle the license response headers
      licenseResponseHeaders: function (headers) {
        // Do something with the headers here
        console.log(headers);
      },

      // Whether to send cookies with the license request
      withCredentials: true,
    },
  });
});
</script>
```

## Known Issues

SEE: https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/60276

1. Fairplay content cannot be played if `TextTrack`s exist. Beyond embedding them within the manifest, the only way to side load them is after the keys are updated.

  ```js
  videojs('player_id').ready(function () {
    var player = this;

    player.on('loadeddata', function () {
      player.addRemoteTextTrack(...);
    });
  });
  ```

1. New Fairplay content cannot be played once MediaKeys have been attached to the video element (Unless its the same source). To get around this issue we need to clear those keys.

  ```js
  player.reset();

  player.src(...);
  ```

1. Combining the issues of #1 and #2. Before you can play *another* source, you must clear out the existing `TextTrack`s.

  ```js
  player.remoteTextTracks().tracks_.forEach(function (track) {
    player.removeRemoteTextTrack(track);
  });

  // the current `TextTrack` implementation operates on events and because of this we have to wait a
  // tick before executing a reset, otherwise the `TextTrack`s will get picked up in its associated `Tech`.
  setTimeout(function () {
    player.reset();

    player.src(...);
  }, 0);
  ```
